# Gibbs sampler for Adaptive relaxed Spectral Regularization (GASR) -- Scala version
###Introduction
This is the Scale code for implementing the GASR algorithm in the paper: 
> Yang Song, Jun Zhu, *Bayesian Matrix Completion via Adaptive Relaxed Spectral Regularization*, to appear in AAAI 2016.

There is also a similar (but much faster) [C++ version](https://github.com/hjss06/GASR).
